To display the logo on every slide, add the following code within the <amp-story> element:
<amp-story-grid-layer template="fill">
<div class="amp-logo">
<amp-img src="https://my_logo.png" width="95" height="95" layout="fixed"></amp-img>
</div>
</amp-story-grid-layer>


This code will ensure that your logo is consistently shown across all slides of the web story. To add this code to your tool that automatically fetches and adds a logo to every slide in a web story.

I have a doubt. Will creating a web story using your 3school tool generate clicks and impressions? I have a blog website with multiple-choice questions (MCQs), so would uploading MCQs in web stories be beneficial? Can I upload all slides with images, including quiz questions, or not? Please guide me.

Additionally, all stories generated from your tool are valid and pass the AMP test.

We have created only 8 - 9 web stories for demo purpose using our tool and we got 90k total impressions, 15k total clicks from Google discover. Source:- 3schools

Yes, you can upload all slides with images, including quiz questions, using our 3schools Make Story.

Additionally, it's important to note that web stories can help you attract traffic from Google Discover as well as Google Search. However, the success of your web stories in driving traffic depends on the quality and relevance of your content to your target audience.

I found a reason why this problem happens!
If you upload the downloaded template by clicking the restore button, you will see that error.

I am using mobile phone and how I solved this:-

1. https://www.3schools.in/p/code-editor.html  visit this page and upload the downloaded xml file.

2. Now select the file and copy all code.

3. Next go to Blogger's theme section and click on Edit HTML button and remove all code and paste the copied code and save it.

If your site is already approved by Google AdSense only then you can display AdSense ads in your web story.3schoolsSee the 4 no option of the above image. To display ads, you need pub id & Ads slot.
So, go to AdSense => Ads => overview => and create a Display Ad . You will get a code like the following one.

    data-ad-client="ca-pub-1234567890123456"

How to Add Google FAQ schema in blog post?

Google has announced that to be eligible for FAQ rich results, your site must be a well-known, authoritative government or health website, and follow their other guidelines.

So, using our post editor, you can't add FAQ schema but you can add a faq (question & answer) section. For that go to our post editor › choose Warning › add question & answer.

Video upload problem in 3schools Make Story 2.0

As you know, all the assets (images, music, videos) that you upload in our Web Story Editor are hosted in your Google Drive.

Videos and music are not displayed from direct Google Drive URLs. That's why you can't upload videos and audios directly. However, if you upload videos or audios to another hosting platform, you can add those file links in our Web Story editor.

You can also use Pixels & Tenor images or videos - those you don't need to upload.

<li><b>Blog post / news article :-</b> By default, any post you create in the 3schools editor will be a regular blog post. But if your post is actually a news article, you can add an extra label called <span class="notranslate">"NEWS"</span> to identify it as such.</li>
<li><b>Table Of Contents :-</b> The 3schools editor will automatically add a table of contents at the top of your article. But if you don't want the table of contents to be displayed, you can add an extra label called <span class="notranslate">"NOTOC"</span> to your article.</li>
       <li><b>Voice Typing :-</b> The 3schools editor has a voice typing feature. To use it, first select your language from the right sidebar. Then you can speak, and the editor will automatically convert your voice into written text.</li>

***3schools Make Story 2.0 for developer***
<p>
  If you are a developer (html &amp; css) and want to create a custom page for
  "3schools Make Story 2.0", this article will help you.
</p>
<p>
  Each page is essentially an HTML file that you can upload directly into our
  <a href="https://www.3schools.in/p/make-story.html" target="_blank">Make Story Editor</a>. We have more than 20 pages for Google Web Story. Following this post, you
  can create a new one for yourself or others.
  <a href="https://www.3schools.in/p/webstory-templates.html" target="_blank">See all pages</a>.
</p>
<p>
  First, download the sample <b>HTML file</b> and open it in a code editor like
  Notepad or Visual Studio Code. Note that a page only contains the form
  element. Please follow the steps outlined below.
</p>

<ol class="ol">
  <li>
    As I mentioned earlier, this page is intended solely for development
    purposes. That's why it also contains the <kbd>&lt;style&gt;</kbd> and
    <kbd>&lt;link&gt;</kbd> tags. You don't need to edit those - just focus on
    the <b>form</b> element.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <b>form</b> element has a style attribute, which allows you
    to change the background-color value to any valid hexadecimal color code. It has also some data attributes:</p>
    <ul>
<li><kbd>data-0="10":</kbd> This attribute sets the duration for the current page to 10 seconds. It determines how long the page will be displayed before automatically transitioning to the next page in the Google Web Story.</li>

<li><kbd>data-1="", data-2="":</kbd> These attributes are used to add a link to the current page. If you want to include a link, you can set <kbd>data-1</kbd> to the link text (e.g., "Download") and <kbd>data-2</kbd> to the actual link URL (e.g., "https://www.3schools.in/page.html").</li>

<li><kbd>data-3="#244000"</kbd>: This attribute sets the background color of the current page to the hexadecimal color code "#244000". This value matches the background-color set in the form's style attribute.</li>

<li><kbd>data-4="Image"</kbd>: This attribute specifies that the background media for the current page is an image. You can also set this to "Video" if you want to use a video as the background.</li>

<li><kbd>data-5="", data-6=""</kbd>: These attributes are used to display an image or video on the current page. If you want to include a background image or video, you can set <kbd>data-5</kbd> to the image or video link and <kbd>data-6</kbd> to the alternative text for the image.</li>

<li><kbd>data-7="fade-in"</kbd>: This attribute sets the animation type for the background media (image or video) to a "fade-in" effect. You can choose from various animation types, such as "twirl-in", "fly-in-left", "fly-in-bottom", "drop", etc.</li>

<li><kbd>data-8="0", data-9="0"</kbd>: These attributes control the start and end positions or timing of the animation. <kbd>data-8</kbd> sets the duration of the animation, while <kbd>data-9</kbd> sets the delay before the animation starts.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Inside the <b>form</b> element, there is a <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> with the class <b class="notranslate">"quiz-lower"</b> and the attribute <b class="notranslate">contenteditable="true"</b>. This means that the content within this <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> can be edited directly by the user.</p>

<p>To display content on the page, you can add HTML elements and content inside this <i class="notranslate">"quiz-lower"</i> <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd>. Since this is an inline element, you should use inline CSS to style the content as needed.</p>

<p>For example, you could add a <kbd>&lt;p&gt;</kbd> tag with some text and apply inline styles like this:</p>

<pre class="notranslate"><i class='t-3'>&lt;<i class='n-3'>div </i><i class='a-3'>class</i>=<i class='s-3'>"quiz-lower" </i><i class='a-3'>contenteditable</i>=<i class='s-3'>"true"</i>&gt;</i>
  <i class='t-3'>&lt;<i class='n-3'>p </i><i class='a-3'>style</i>=<i class='s-3'>"<i class="cp-3">color</i>:<i class="cpv-3"> <i class="ci-3">#</i>ffff00</i>;<i class="cp-3"> font-size</i>:<i class="cpv-3"> 18<i class="cpx-3">px</i></i>;<i class="cp-3"> font-weight</i>:<i class="cpv-3"> bold</i>"</i>&gt;</i>This is some editable content for the page.<i class='t-3'>&lt;<i class='n-3'>/p</i>&gt;</i>
<i class='t-3'>&lt;<i class='n-3'>/div</i>&gt;</i></pre>

<p class="note">Remember, the content inside this editable <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> will be displayed as part of the final Google Web Story page. Users can modify this content as needed during the development and editing process.</p>
    <p>The <kbd>absolute</kbd> class can be applied to any element within the <b class="notranslate">"quiz-lower"</b> div to position that element in an absolute manner, with the element being positioned at the bottom of the div and stretching across the full width. Also can use these attributes <kbd>animate-in="fly-in-bottom"</kbd> <kbd>animate-in-delay="0s"</kbd> <kbd>animate-in-duration="2.5s"</kbd>.</p>
 <pre class="notranslate"><i class='t-3'>&lt;<i class='n-3'>div </i><i class='a-3'>class</i>=<i class='s-3'>"quiz-lower" </i><i class='a-3'>contenteditable</i>=<i class='s-3'>"true"</i>&gt;</i>
  <i class='t-3'>&lt;<i class='n-3'>div </i><i class='a-3'>class</i>=<i class='s-3'>"absolute" </i><i class='a-3'>animate-in</i>=<i class='s-3'>"fly-in-bottom" </i><i class='a-3'>animate-in-delay</i>=<i class='s-3'>"0s" </i><i class='a-3'>animate-in-duration</i>=<i class='s-3'>"2.5s"</i> <i class='a-3'>style</i>=<i class='s-3'>"<i class="cp-3">bottom</i>:<i class="cpv-3">50<i class="cpx-3">px</i></i>;<i class="cp-3">left</i>:<i class="cpv-3">40<i class="cpx-3">px</i></i>;<i class="cp-3">background-color</i>:<i class="cpv-3"><i class="ci-3">#</i>ff00ff</i>;<i class="cp-3">padding</i>:<i class="cpv-3">8<i class="cpx-3">px</i></i>;<i class="cp-3">border-radius</i>:<i class="cpv-3">50%</i>;<i class="cp-3">height</i>:<i class="cpv-3">50<i class="cpx-3">px</i></i>;<i class="cp-3">width</i>:<i class="cpv-3">50<i class="cpx-3">px</i></i>"</i>&gt;</i>
  <i class='t-3'>&lt;<i class='n-3'>/div</i>&gt;</i>
<i class='t-3'>&lt;<i class='n-3'>/div</i>&gt;</i></pre>
  
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not use the <kbd>&lt;img&gt;</kbd> tag to add an image on a page. Instead, use the following <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> element:</p>
    <pre class="notranslate"><i class='t-3'>&lt;<i class='n-3'>div </i><i class='a-3'>class</i>=<i class='s-3'>"addImg absolute"</i> </i><i class='a-3'>animate-in</i>=<i class='s-3'>"whoosh-in-right" </i><i class='a-3'>animate-in-delay</i>=<i class='s-3'>"0s" </i><i class='a-3'>animate-in-duration</i>=<i class='s-3'>"2s"</i> <i class='a-3'>style</i>=<i class='s-3'>"<i class="cp-3">top</i>:<i class="cpv-3"> 15%</i>;<i class="cp-3"> left</i>:<i class="cpv-3"> unset</i>;<i class="cp-3"> right</i>:<i class="cpv-3"> 2%</i>;<i class="cp-3"> bottom</i>:<i class="cpv-3"> unset</i>;<i class="cp-3"> width</i>:<i class="cpv-3"> 60<i class="cpx-3">px</i></i>;<i class="cp-3"> height</i>:<i class="cpv-3"> 60<i class="cpx-3">px</i></i>;<i class="cp-3"> border-radius</i>:<i class="cpv-3"> 50%</i>;<i class="cp-3"> background-repeat</i>:<i class="cpv-3"> no-repeat</i>;<i class="cp-3"> background-size</i>:<i class="cpv-3"> cover</i>;<i class="cp-3"> background-image</i>:<i class="cpv-3"> url('https</i>:<i class="cpv-3">//app.3schools.in/logo.png')</i>;"</i>&gt;
<i class='t-3'>&lt;<i class='n-3'>/div</i>&gt;</i></pre>
    <p>In this way, you can change the image position by changing the property in the <kbd>style</kbd> attribute. You can also change the animation.</p>

<p class="note">Note: When someone uploads this page in the 3schools web story editor, they can also change the image from the tool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>When the development is complete, create a new <kbd>HTML</kbd> file and insert only the <b>form</b> element. Now, upload the created page to the <b class="notranslate">3schools web story editor</b> and click the <kbd>preview</kbd> button.</li>
</ol>
