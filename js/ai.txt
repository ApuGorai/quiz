To display the logo on every slide, add the following code within the <amp-story> element:
<amp-story-grid-layer template="fill">
<div class="amp-logo">
<amp-img src="https://my_logo.png" width="95" height="95" layout="fixed"></amp-img>
</div>
</amp-story-grid-layer>


This code will ensure that your logo is consistently shown across all slides of the web story. To add this code to your tool that automatically fetches and adds a logo to every slide in a web story.

I have a doubt. Will creating a web story using your 3school tool generate clicks and impressions? I have a blog website with multiple-choice questions (MCQs), so would uploading MCQs in web stories be beneficial? Can I upload all slides with images, including quiz questions, or not? Please guide me.

Additionally, all stories generated from your tool are valid and pass the AMP test.

We have created only 8 - 9 web stories for demo purpose using our tool and we got 90k total impressions, 15k total clicks from Google discover. Source:- 3schools

Yes, you can upload all slides with images, including quiz questions, using our 3schools Make Story.

Additionally, it's important to note that web stories can help you attract traffic from Google Discover as well as Google Search. However, the success of your web stories in driving traffic depends on the quality and relevance of your content to your target audience.

I found a reason why this problem happens!
If you upload the downloaded template by clicking the restore button, you will see that error.

I am using mobile phone and how I solved this:-

1. https://www.3schools.in/p/code-editor.html  visit this page and upload the downloaded xml file.

2. Now select the file and copy all code.

3. Next go to Blogger's theme section and click on Edit HTML button and remove all code and paste the copied code and save it.

If your site is already approved by Google AdSense only then you can display AdSense ads in your web story.3schoolsSee the 4 no option of the above image. To display ads, you need pub id & Ads slot.
So, go to AdSense => Ads => overview => and create a Display Ad . You will get a code like the following one.

    data-ad-client="ca-pub-1234567890123456"

Google has announced that to be eligible for FAQ rich results, your site must be a well-known, authoritative government or health website, and follow their other guidelines.

So, using our post editor, you can't add FAQ schema but you can add a faq (question & answer) section. For that go to our post editor › choose Warning › add question & answer.

Video upload problem in 3schools Make Story 2.0

As you know, all the assets (images, music, videos) that you upload in our Web Story Editor are hosted in your Google Drive.

Videos and music are not displayed from direct Google Drive URLs. That's why you can't upload videos and audios directly. However, if you upload videos or audios to another hosting platform, you can add those file links in our Web Story editor.

You can also use Pixels & Tenor images or videos - those you don't need to upload.

<li><b>Blog post / news article :-</b> By default, any post you create in the 3schools editor will be a regular blog post. But if your post is actually a news article, you can add an extra label called <span class="notranslate">"NEWS"</span> to identify it as such.</li>
<li><b>Table Of Contents :-</b> The 3schools editor will automatically add a table of contents at the top of your article. But if you don't want the table of contents to be displayed, you can add an extra label called <span class="notranslate">"NOTOC"</span> to your article.</li>
       <li><b>Voice Typing :-</b> The 3schools editor has a voice typing feature. To use it, first select your language from the right sidebar. Then you can speak, and the editor will automatically convert your voice into written text.</li>
